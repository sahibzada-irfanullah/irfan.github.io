#### Hi, nice to meet you!

I am an ML Researcher currently residing in South Korea, specializing in natural language processing, machine learning with graphs, computer vision, data mining, crisis computing, information retrieval, big data, and distributed computing. Learning with multimodalities also fascinates me very much. My focus is on designing, developing, analyzing, and improving large-scale systems that are usable by a wide spectrum of users.

With a strong academic background and a record of winning multiple awards for excellent performance, I have also gained significant professional experience in teaching, research, and industry. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working in leading national and international academic and industrial institutions. My expertise has enabled me to co-author several conference and journal papers.

What sets me apart from other researchers is my unique approach and perspective on the inter-disciplinary areas of graphs, NLP, computer vision, and machine learning. I am driven by a passion for creating user-friendly systems that have a significant impact on people's lives.
