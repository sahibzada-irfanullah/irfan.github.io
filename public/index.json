Among them, Single-stage object detectors (SSD) mainly depends on classification network to extract features, multiple feature maps to predict, and classification confidence to guide the filtration of the overlapping prediction boxes. However, there are still two problems causing some inaccurate results: (1) In the process of feature extraction, with the layer-by-layer acquisition of semantic information, local information is gradually lost, resulting into less representative feature maps; (2) During the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm due to inconsistency in classification and regression tasks, the classification confidence and predicted detection position cannot accurately indicate the position of the prediction boxes. Methods: In order to address these aforementioned issues, we propose a new architecture, a modified version of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), named Precise Single Stage Detector (PSSD). Firstly, we improve the features by adding extra layers to SSD. Secondly, we construct a simple and effective feature enhancement module to expand the receptive field step by step for each layer and enhance its local and semantic information. Finally, we design a more efficient loss function to predict the IOU between the prediction boxes and ground truth boxes, and the threshold IOU guides classification training and attenuates the scores, which are used by the NMS algorithm. Main Results: Benefiting from the above optimization, the proposed model PSSD achieves exciting performance in real-time. Specifically, with the hardware of Titan Xp and the input size of 320 pix, PSSD achieves 33.8 mAP at 45 FPS speed on MS COCO benchmark and 81.28 mAP at 66 FPS speed on Pascal VOC 2007 outperforming state-of-the-art object detection models.

Because of the implicit data dependence in the big graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges, it is hard for industrial communities to exploit these methods to address real-world challenges at scale. The skewness property of big graphs, distributed file system performance penalty on small k-hop neighborhood subgraphs, and varying size of subgraph makes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) training further challenging in a distributed environment using parameter servers. To address such issues, we propose a scalable, layered, fault-tolerance, and in-memory distributed computing-based graph neural network framework called Graph Distributed Learning Library (GDLL). The base layer utilizes an optimized distributed file system and a scalable graph data store to reduce the performance penalty. The second layer provides distributed graph processing using in-memory graph programming models while optimizing and hiding the underlying complexity of information complete subgraph computation. In the third layer, GNN modules are deployed on top of the first two layers for efficient distributed training using parameter servers. Finally, we evaluate and compare GDLL with the state-of-the-art solutions and outperform it significantly in terms of efficiency while maintaining similar GNN convergence.","tags":["Graph neural networks","GNN","Gig graph learning","Distributed GNN","Large scale graph","Graph learning"],"title":"GDLL: A Scalable and Share Nothing Architecture Based Distributed Graph Neural Networks Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irfan Ullah","Sharifullah Khan","Muhammad Imran","Young-Koo Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to download the Bibtex citation of the paper.

It also aims to bridge the gap among large-scale video analytics challenges, big data solutions, and cloud computing. In this study, we clarify the basic nomenclatures that govern the video analytics domain and the characteristics of video big data while establishing its relationship with cloud computing. We propose a service-oriented layered reference architecture for intelligent video big data analytics in the cloud.

Monitoring  videos  captured by surveillance cameras is always a difficult and time-consuming task. There is a need for automated analysis using computer vision methods in order to recognize/predict abnormal activities and assist authorities. Once, videos are processed using computer vision technologies; another problem is how this data is indexed for search, analysis, and real-time alerts since a large number of cameras continuously capture videos resulting vast  amounts  of  data.  In  order  to  address  this  issue,  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  generic  architecture  for  distributed intelligent surveillance and is composed of four layers. The first layer acquisition large number of the  video  streams  from  for  device  independent  video  stream  data  sources.  In  the  second  layer,  we  use  computer vision algorithms for semantic video annotation while exploiting the distributed in-memory computing engine. The third layer is used to persist the video stream and the to manage the intermediate results being produced by the second layer. Finally, the intermediate results are mapped to the RDF according to domain-specific application.","tags":[],"title":"An improved co-training approach for document Sentiment classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

(We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

Many people turn to social media during disasters for requesting help and/or providing relief to others. However, the majority of social media posts seeking help could not properly be detected and remained concealed because often they are noisy and ill-formed. Existing systems lack in planning an effective strategy for tweet preprocessing and grasping the contexts of tweets. This research, first of all, formally defines request tweets in the context of social networking sites, hereafter rweets, along with their different primary types and sub-types. Our main contributions are the identification and categorization of rweets. For rweet identification, we employ two approaches, namely a rule-based and logistic regression, and show their high precision and F1 scores. The rweets classification into sub-types such as medical, food, shelter, using logistic regression shows promising results and outperforms exiting works. Finally, we introduce an architecture to store intermediate data to accelerate the development process of the machine learning classifiers.","tags":["Lung cancer","Juxta-pleural nodules","Computer aided detection (CAD)","Segmentation","Intensity based thresholding"],"title":"Adaptive thresholding technique for segmentation and juxtapleural nodules inclusion in lung segments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
